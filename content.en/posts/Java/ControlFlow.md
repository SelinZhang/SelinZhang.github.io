## Conditional statement

The conditional statement is a construction that allows a program to perform different computations depending on the value of a Boolean expression. If it is `true`, the program performs one computation; otherwise, if it is `false`, the program performs another computation. Here are some examples of Boolean expressions: `a > b`, `i - j == 1`, and so on.

The conditional statement has different forms. We will use all of them.

### The single if-case

The simplest form of the conditional statement consists of the keyword `if`, a Boolean expression enclosed in parentheses, and a body enclosed in curly braces.

```java
if (expression) {
    // body: do something
}
```

If the expression is `true`, the statements inside the code block are executed; otherwise, the program skips them.

See the following example.

```java
int age = ...; // it has a value
if (age > 100) {
    System.out.println("Very experienced person");
}
```

In this example, if the `age` is greater than 100 the code prints "Very experienced person", otherwise, it does nothing.

Sometimes you will see a situation where the expression in a condition is a single `boolean` type variable. Instead of writing `b == true` or `b == false`, use this variable (or its negation with `!`) as the Boolean expression:

```java
boolean b = ...; // it is true or false
if (b) { // or !b
    // do something
}
```

A conditional statement can be used in any place in a program where the statement is expected. It can even be nested inside another conditional statement to perform multistage checks.

### The if-else-cases

The if-case above can be extended with the keyword `else` and another body to do alternative actions when the expression is `false`.

```java
if (expression) {    
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
```

In this case, if the expression is `true`, then the first code block is executed; otherwise, the second code block is executed, but not both together.

In the example below, the program outputs different text depending on the value of `num` (even or odd).

> [!NOTE]
> Note: a number is even if it can be divided exactly by 2; otherwise it's odd.

```java
int num = ...; // the num is initialized by some value

if (num % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("It's an even number");
} else {    
    System.out.println("It's an odd number");
}
```

Since a number can only be even or odd, only one message will be displayed. If `num` is 10, the program outputs `"It's an even number"`. If the value is 11, it outputs `"It's an odd number"`.

### The if-else-if-cases

The most general form of the conditional statement consists of several conditions and `else-if`-branches.

```java
if (expression0) {
    // do something
} else if (expression1) {
    // do something else 1
// ...
} else if (expressionN) {
    // do something else N
}
```

The following code outputs recommendations about what computer you need to buy depending on your budget.

```java
long dollars = ...; // your budget

if (dollars < 1000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a laptop");
} else if (dollars < 2000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a personal computer");
} else if (dollars < 100_000) {
    System.out.println("Buy a server");
} else {
    System.out.println("Buy a data center or a quantum computer");
}
```

This conditional statement has four branches: `dollars < 1000`, `dollars < 2000`, `dollars < 100_000` and `dollars >= 100_000`. For example, if the value of `dollars` is `10_000`, it prints `"Buy a server"` because `10_000` is more than `2000` , which means that the first and the second conditions are false, and less than `100_000` , which means that the third condition is true.

A conditional statement with multiple branches creates a {{< tooltip "decision tree" "In Java, a decision tree is a way of organizing a conditional statement with multiple branches, based on the value of a single variable." >}}, whose nodes consist of boolean expressions, and each branch is marked with true or false. The true-branch leads to a block of statements to be executed and a `false`-branch leads to the next condition to be checked. The last false-branch means "in all other cases".

> [!NOTE]
> When talking about conditions, programmers often use the term "control flow statements". **Control flow** is the order in which various parts of a program are executed. You will probably meet this term in our topics and on other external resources.

The picture below demonstrates such a tree for the example with computers.

This example completes our examination of conditional statements.




## One-line condition with ternary operator

Quite often you may need to assign different values to a variable depending on a certain condition. You may do it conveniently with the help of the {{< tooltip "ternary operator" "In Java, a *ternary operator* is a concise way to express simple conditional statements." >}}. It provides a compact way to express simple conditional statements. Instead of writing lengthy if-else constructs for basic conditions, you can use the ternary operator to achieve the same result in a more concise manner.

### What is the ternary operator?

The ternary operator is an operator which {{< tooltip evaluates "In Java, evaluate refers to the process of determining the value of an expression or a variable.">}} a condition and chooses one of two cases to execute. It is also called the **conditional operator**. The operator can be considered as a form of the `if`-then-`else` statement. The ternary operator should not be confused with the conditional statement, despite their similarity. This operator can be used in places **where an expression is expected**.

Sometimes the **ternary operator** is more readable and concise than the corresponding if statement.

Let's start learning this operator with an example. Suppose we have to find the maximum of two int variables, `a` and `b`. It is easy to write using a conditional statement:

```java
int a = ...;
int b = ...;
int max = ...;

if (a > b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}
```

Here is what an equivalent ternary operator looks like:

```java
int max = a > b ? a : b;
```

This code is more concise than the code above, isn't it?

The general syntax of the ternary operator is the following:

```java
result = condition ? trueCase : elseCase;
```

It includes two special symbols `?` and `:`.

Here, the `condition` is a Boolean expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. If this expression is `true`, the ternary operator evaluates trueCase, otherwise `elseCase` is evaluated. It is important that `trueCase` and `elseCase` are expressions which can be reduced to a common type. This type determines the type of the `result`.

### Conclusion

The ternary operator in Java is a concise way to evaluate a condition and assign values to a variable based on that condition. It is similar to an if-else statement but can be more readable and concise in certain situations. The syntax is result = condition ? trueCase : elseCase, and it's useful for making quick decisions in code. However, nesting ternary operators should be done with caution as it can reduce readability.
